# 🚀 Prompt Craft AI

**The Elite AI-Powered Full-Stack Application Generator**

Prompt Craft AI is a powerful development tool that transforms your natural language ideas into production-ready full-stack applications instantly. Powered by **Google Gemini** and **Puter.js**, it acts as an expert software architect, generating comprehensive codebases, database schemas, and interactive previews in seconds.

## ✨ Key Features

*   **🗣️ Natural Language to Code**: Simply describe your app idea (e.g., *"A SaaS dashboard for fleet management with real-time tracking"*), and watch it come to life.
*   **🏗️ Complete Architecture**: Generates structured, industry-standard code:
    *   **Frontend**: React components with Tailwind CSS styling.
    *   **Backend**: Node.js/Express API structures with authentication middleware.
    *   **Database**: Mongoose schemas for MongoDB.
*   **👁️ Instant Interactive Preview**: Creates a fully functional `preview.html` simulation with mock data, dynamic state, and CRUD operations so you can test the UX immediately without setting up a backend.
